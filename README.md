<b>CodeAcademy JavaScript Project: Rock, Paper, or Scissors</b>
<p>(From the course: Learn JavaScript)</p>

<p>Description: <br>
Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins. The possible outcomes are: <br>
- Rock destroys scissors. <br>
- Scissors cut paper. <br>
- Paper covers rock. <br>
- If there's a tie, then the game ends in a draw. <br>
- But wait... there's also a surprise waiting for you to discover! </p>
<p><em><u>Bonus Challenge:</u> Player and computer gets a level up everytime they win so let's see who can get to level 100 first. Ready, get set, GO!!! </em>üòù</p>

<p>I like to write codes to build applications and make things move but I like to see them in action too. Thus after completing the Rock, Paper or Scissors JavaScript project on CodeAcademy, I decided to create a complete version that can be played on the browser.</p>
<p>Try out the game at the link below and I hope you will enjoy playing it too! (>‚Äø‚ó†)‚úå</p>
